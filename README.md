Here is the code used for various Kaggle competitions. These competitions are ML and data science challenge based around real-life use cases. 

### Competition 1: NLP -- PII Data Detection
The goal of this competition is to provide a model capable of detecting and labelling student data in essays. I have first created a baseline using a pre-trained model (Presidio by Microsoft). Then, I used different models like Bert to improve efficiency.

### Competition 2: Computer Vision -- Digit Recognition
Based around the famous MNIST dataset, the goal of this competition is to build models able to correctly classify handwritten digits. It is a simple playground to experiment using a lot of models, from sklearn to handmade CNNs and ensembles of more complex models such as ResNet and DenseNet.
